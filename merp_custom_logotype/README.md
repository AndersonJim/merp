# mERP Customer Logo

The customer logotype is stored in base64 format within `merp.config` model.
As for now, there are two main properties:
| key | value | write_date |
|---|---|---|
|`logo.file`|<base64>|1955-11-12 06:38:00.000000|
|`logo.name`|company_logo.png|1955-11-12 06:38:00.000000|

Note, there is `write_date` field that could be used to define whether property value (eg. logotype) is updated recently.
